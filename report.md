**Report: The Impact of Quantum Computing on Cybersecurity Threats**

**1. Introduction to Quantum Computing and Cybersecurity**

Quantum computing represents a fundamental shift in computation, harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations far beyond the capabilities of classical computers. Unlike traditional computers that use bits representing either 0 or 1, quantum computers use quantum bits, or "qubits," which can represent 0, 1, or both simultaneously through a property called superposition [Source 7: Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Explained - NordPass](https://nordpass.com/blog/quantum-computing-cybersecurity/). This allows quantum computers to explore a vast number of possibilities concurrently, offering the potential to solve complex problems in fields like medicine, materials science, and artificial intelligence [Source 6: Quantum Computing is a Long-Term Cybersecurity Risk, But ...](https://thequantuminsider.com/2025/02/01/quantum-computing-is-a-long-term-cybersecurity-risk-but-deserves-immediate-attention-analysts-report/).

Cybersecurity, in turn, encompasses the practices, technologies, and processes designed to protect computer systems, networks, and data from attack, damage, or unauthorized access. A cornerstone of modern cybersecurity is cryptography – the science of encoding and decoding information. Encryption algorithms are essential for securing data transmission (e.g., emails, financial transactions), protecting stored data, and ensuring digital identity authentication [Source 5: Is Quantum Computing a Cybersecurity Threat? | American Scientist](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/is-quantum-computing-a-cybersecurity-threat). Our current digital security infrastructure heavily relies on cryptographic methods presumed to be secure against attacks by even the most powerful classical computers.

The intersection of quantum computing and cybersecurity is becoming increasingly critical because the very power that makes quantum computers potentially revolutionary also equips them to break many of the cryptographic systems currently safeguarding global digital communications and data [Source 1: What Is Quantum Computing's Threat to Cybersecurity? - Palo Alto ...](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-quantum-computings-threat-to-cybersecurity), [Source 5: Is Quantum Computing a Cybersecurity Threat? | American Scientist](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/is-quantum-computing-a-cybersecurity-threat). Understanding this intersection is vital for preparing for a future where the rules of digital security may be profoundly altered.

**2. Current Cybersecurity Landscape and its Vulnerabilities**

In the classical computing era, cybersecurity relies heavily on cryptographic algorithms to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. Two main types of cryptography are employed: symmetric and asymmetric (or public-key) cryptography [Source 5: Is Quantum Computing a Cybersecurity Threat? | American Scientist](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/is-quantum-computing-a-cybersecurity-threat).

Symmetric cryptography uses the same secret key for both encryption and decryption. Algorithms like the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are widely used and considered very secure against classical attacks, provided the key length is sufficient [Source 5: Is Quantum Computing a Cybersecurity Threat? | American Scientist](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/is-quantum-computing-a-cybersecurity-threat), [Source 7: Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Explained - NordPass](https://nordpass.com/blog/quantum-computing-cybersecurity/).

Asymmetric cryptography, or public-key cryptography, uses a pair of keys: a public key, which can be shared openly, and a private key, which must be kept secret. This enables secure communication without pre-sharing a secret key and is fundamental to secure internet protocols (like HTTPS), digital signatures, and public key infrastructure (PKI). Widely used public-key algorithms include RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) [Source 1: What Is Quantum Computing's Threat to Cybersecurity? - Palo Alto ...](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-quantum-computings-threat-to-cybersecurity), [Source 5: Is Quantum Computing a Cybersecurity Threat? | American Scientist](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/is-quantum-computing-a-cybersecurity-threat).

The security of these public-key systems relies on the computational difficulty for classical computers to solve certain mathematical problems, such as factoring large numbers (for RSA) or computing discrete logarithms (for Diffie-Hellman and ECC) [Source 5: Is Quantum Computing a Cybersecurity Threat? | American Scientist](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/is-quantum-computing-a-cybersecurity-threat). While classical computers struggle with these problems, making the encryption strong for practical purposes today, the advent of powerful quantum computers fundamentally changes this equation, creating a significant vulnerability in our current cybersecurity infrastructure [Source 2: Quantum computing cybersecurity risk: PwC](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/cybersecurity-risk-regulatory/library/quantum-computing-cybersecurity-risk.html).

**3. Quantum Computing's Threat to Modern Encryption**

The primary threat quantum computing poses to cybersecurity stems from its potential ability to break widely used public-key encryption algorithms. Quantum computers capable of running Shor's algorithm could efficiently solve the underlying mathematical problems (large number factorization and discrete logarithm computation) that guarantee the security of RSA, ECC, and Diffie-Hellman cryptography [Source 5: Is Quantum Computing a Cybersecurity Threat? | American Scientist](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/is-quantum-computing-a-cybersecurity-threat), [Source 8: Post-quantum cryptography - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography). This would render these currently secure methods ineffective [Source 1: What Is Quantum Computing's Threat to Cybersecurity? - Palo Alto ...](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-quantum-computings-threat-to-cybersecurity).

While symmetric encryption like AES is also theoretically vulnerable to quantum attacks (e.g., using Grover's algorithm), the impact is less dramatic; security can generally be restored by sufficiently increasing the key length [Source 5: Is Quantum Computing a Cybersecurity Threat? | American Scientist](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/is-quantum-computing-a-cybersecurity-threat), [Source 8: Post-quantum cryptography - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography). Public-key systems, however, face a more fundamental threat.

The timescale for this threat materializing is debated. Current quantum computers lack the necessary processing power (measured in stable qubits and low error rates) to break strong, real-world encryption [Source 5: Is Quantum Computing a Cybersecurity Threat? | American Scientist](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/is-quantum-computing-a-cybersecurity-threat), [Source 7: Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Explained - NordPass](https://nordpass.com/blog/quantum-computing-cybersecurity/), [Source 8: Post-quantum cryptography - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography). Some analyses suggest high-security encryption like RSA-2048 might be safe until the 2050s or 2060s, while others, considering potential faster progress in error correction and algorithms, forecast potential decryption capabilities emerging around 2035 or even 2030 [Source 3: What is the cyber security risk from quantum computing?](https://kpmg.com/au/en/home/insights/2024/04/cyber-security-risk-from-quantum-computing.html), [Source 6: Quantum Computing is a Long-Term Cybersecurity Risk, But ...](https://thequantuminsider.com/2025/02/01/quantum-computing-is-a-long-term-cybersecurity-risk-but-deserves-immediate-attention-analysts-report/). Despite the uncertainty, the threat is considered significant enough to warrant immediate attention [Source 4: How tech firms are tackling the risks of quantum computing](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/04/quantum-computing-cybersecurity-risks/), [Source 6: Quantum Computing is a Long-Term Cybersecurity Risk, But ...](https://thequantuminsider.com/2025/02/01/quantum-computing-is-a-long-term-cybersecurity-risk-but-deserves-immediate-attention-analysts-report/).

The potential impact, often referred to as "Q-Day," is widespread [Source 7: Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Explained - NordPass](https://nordpass.com/blog/quantum-computing-cybersecurity/). Breaking public-key cryptography could:
*   Expose sensitive data protected by current encryption standards [Source 1: What Is Quantum Computing's Threat to Cybersecurity? - Palo Alto ...](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-quantum-computings-threat-to-cybersecurity).

A significant concern is the "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" (HNDL) attack strategy. Adversaries, potentially nation-states, could intercept and store encrypted data today, waiting for sufficiently powerful quantum computers to become available to decrypt it in the future [Source 1: What Is Quantum Computing's Threat to Cybersecurity? - Palo Alto ...](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-quantum-computings-threat-to-cybersecurity), [Source 2: Quantum computing cybersecurity risk: PwC](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/cybersecurity-risk-regulatory/library/quantum-computing-cybersecurity-risk.html), [Source 3: What is the cyber security risk from quantum computing?](https://kpmg.com/au/en/home/insights/2024/04/cyber-security-risk-from-quantum-computing.html), [Source 8: Post-quantum cryptography - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography). This makes data with long-term sensitivity (e.g., health records, financial data, government secrets) particularly vulnerable now [Source 3: What is the cyber security risk from quantum computing?](https://kpmg.com/au/en/home/insights/2024/04/cyber-security-risk-from-quantum-computing.html).

**4. Mitigation Strategies: Post-Quantum Cryptography**

In response to the looming quantum threat, researchers and institutions worldwide are developing and standardizing new cryptographic methods collectively known as Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) or quantum-resistant cryptography [Source 1: What Is Quantum Computing's Threat to Cybersecurity? - Palo Alto ...](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-quantum-computings-threat-to-cybersecurity), [Source 5: Is Quantum Computing a Cybersecurity Threat? | American Scientist](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/is-quantum-computing-a-cybersecurity-threat). PQC encompasses algorithms designed to be secure against attacks from both classical and quantum computers [Source 7: Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Explained - NordPass](https://nordpass.com/blog/quantum-computing-cybersecurity/). These algorithms are based on different mathematical problems believed to be hard for quantum computers to solve [Source 8: Post-quantum cryptography - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography).

The development of PQC involves exploring various families of mathematical approaches. The main categories showing promise include [Source 8: Post-quantum cryptography - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography), [Source 9: PQC- Lattices, Codes, and Hashes - Medium](https://medium.com/@aditi.rupade/pqc-lattices-codes-and-hashes-1d0a7965c4ae):

Examples include schemes like Learning With Errors (LWE) and NTRU [Source 8: Post-quantum cryptography - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography), [Source 9: PQC- Lattices, Codes, and Hashes - Medium](https://medium.com/@aditi.rupade/pqc-lattices-codes-and-hashes-1d0a7965c4ae). LWE introduces errors into systems of equations to create cryptographic security [Source 9: PQC- Lattices, Codes, and Hashes - Medium](https://medium.com/@aditi.rupade/pqc-lattices-codes-and-hashes-1d0a7965c4ae).
*   **Code-based cryptography:** Uses error-correcting codes, with security based on the difficulty of decoding a random linear code. Examples include the McEliece and Niederreiter cryptosystems [Source 8: Post-quantum cryptography - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography). These often involve large public keys compared to current systems [Source 9: PQC- Lattices, Codes, and Hashes - Medium](https://medium.com/@aditi.rupade/pqc-lattices-codes-and-hashes-1d0a7965c4ae).
*   **Hash-based cryptography:** Builds upon secure hash functions. These are primarily used for digital signatures (e.g., Merkle signatures, XMSS) and rely on the collision resistance of the underlying hash functions [Source 8: Post-quantum cryptography - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography), [Source 9: PQC- Lattices, Codes, and Hashes - Medium](https://medium.com/@aditi.rupade/pqc-lattices-codes-and-hashes-1d0a7965c4ae).
